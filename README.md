Kanshi-sha (Observer) is a simple file watcher for .go files. (WIP)

I am trying out Go (Golang), and yes, nobody likes manually running their files all the time. Something like:

``` go run /cmd/main.go   ```

*** For me, I don’t. I don’t know about you 🫵🏽. ***


So, I decided to write Kanshi-sha, a simple .go file watcher. (It is rudimentary now, but I hope it does the job.)

Yes, I know there are easier tools out there, but I just want to add something to my toolkit.

Yes, you might be thinking it is a memory black hole 🕳️, but no, it isn’t one because it kills the process and restarts it again 🤣. It might not be the best approach, but it should help for now.

Yeah, I hate writing such a tool on my Mac. I will move it to my Linux for testing.
