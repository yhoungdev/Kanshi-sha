##  Kanshi-sha ( Observer ) is a simple file watcher for .Go files 

 I am trying out GO lang, and yes, nobody likes manually run their files all time 
something like ``` go run /cmd/main.go ``` 

``` For me i don't, i dont know about you 🫵🏽 ```.

So I decided to write Kanshi-sha a simple .Go file watcher. ( it it is ludicrous now, but i hope it does the job 

Yes i know there are easy tools out there, but i just want to add something to my kitchen.

Yes, you might be thinking it is a memory black hole 🕳️, but no, it isn't one because it kills the process and restarts it again 🤣, might not be the best approach, but it should help for now 


Yea, i hate writing such tool from my mac. I would move it to my Linux for test
